Get Best and Worst Movies
Search the 'marvel' movie table in the database to find the best or worst movies.

The function should receive 4 parameters: * db_connection - a parameter of the database connection * rating_type - choose 'tomatoes' or 'metacritic' to rank by one of these ratings * order_dir - either 'ASC' or 'DESC' for the order of your results (DESC is best movies, ASC is worst) * limit - how many results to return

We only want to select the title of the movie and the rating we are searching for.

Movie Spreadsheet

Example:

result = get_best_and_worst_movies(db_connection, 'metacritic', 'DESC', limit=3)

print(result[0]) # ('Black Panther', 88)
print(result[4]) # ('Thor: Ragnarok', 74)
